&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently embarked on an exciting journey into AI and web development, leveraging my experience as a product manager at Ooredoo to explore new technical frontiers. Having successfully managed digital products and led cross-functional teams throughout my career, I&amp;rsquo;m now building the technical skills to complement my business expertise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-beginning-from-product-management-to-code">&lt;strong>The Beginning: From Product Management to Code&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My background in managing digital content and new verticals at Ooredoo gave me firsthand exposure to technology implementation, but always from the business side. I worked extensively with development teams on product specifications, feature prioritization, and user testing, which sparked my curiosity about the technical underpinnings of these digital products.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://Mishal.pm/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Mishal.pm/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong>Hassan Mishal Junaid&lt;/strong> 👋&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recently completed a fascinating project for my AI and Decision Making course in my Master of Business Analytics program, and I wanted to share this journey with you all. Our team tackled a real-world business problem: customer churn in the telecommunications industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge-predicting-who">&lt;strong>The Challenge: Predicting Who&amp;rsquo;s About to Leave&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Telecom companies face a constant battle to retain customers in today&amp;rsquo;s competitive market. Did you know that acquiring new customers costs significantly more than retaining existing ones? This makes identifying customers at risk of leaving (churning) incredibly valuable.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
