&lt;h2 id="abstract">&lt;strong>Abstract&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Predicting graduate student placement is critical for educational institutions aiming to enhance student outcomes and optimize resource allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models for graduate placement prediction through a multi-faceted approach that integrates methodological rigor with practical business applicationsÂ¹.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Utilizing a dataset of 215 graduate students, we systematically compared the performance of individual classifiers against advanced ensemble methods. The methodology is distinguished by its use of domain-driven feature engineering to create novel predictors, such as an &lt;strong>Experience-Weighted Test Score&lt;/strong>, and a comprehensive cost-benefit framework to quantify the financial impact of model implementation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
