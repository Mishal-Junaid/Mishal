&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently embarked on an exciting journey into AI and web development, leveraging my experience as a product manager at Ooredoo to explore new technical frontiers. Having successfully managed digital products and led cross-functional teams throughout my career, I&amp;rsquo;m now building the technical skills to complement my business expertise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-beginning-from-product-management-to-code">&lt;strong>The Beginning: From Product Management to Code&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My background in managing digital content and new verticals at Ooredoo gave me firsthand exposure to technology implementation, but always from the business side. I worked extensively with development teams on product specifications, feature prioritization, and user testing, which sparked my curiosity about the technical underpinnings of these digital products.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
