&lt;p>The conversation around Artificial Intelligence often focuses on replacement - machines taking over tasks that humans used to do. But I believe there&amp;rsquo;s a much more exciting story unfolding: &lt;strong>AI Augmentation&lt;/strong>. This approach positions AI not as a substitute for human intelligence, but as a powerful collaborator that enhances our cognitive capabilities and helps us achieve more than ever before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My AI and Web Development Journey</title><link>https://Mishal.pm/posts/my-ai-and-web-development-journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Mishal.pm/posts/my-ai-and-web-development-journey/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="my-ai-and-web-development-journey">&lt;strong>My AI and Web Development Journey&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently embarked on an exciting journey into AI and web development, leveraging my experience as a product manager at Ooredoo to explore new technical frontiers. Having successfully managed digital products and led cross-functional teams throughout my career, I&amp;rsquo;m now building the technical skills to complement my business expertise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recently completed a fascinating project for my AI and Decision Making course in my Master of Business Analytics program, and I wanted to share this journey with you all. Our team tackled a real-world business problem: customer churn in the telecommunications industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge-predicting-who">&lt;strong>The Challenge: Predicting Who&amp;rsquo;s About to Leave&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Telecom companies face a constant battle to retain customers in today&amp;rsquo;s competitive market. Did you know that acquiring new customers costs significantly more than retaining existing ones? This makes identifying customers at risk of leaving (churning) incredibly valuable.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
