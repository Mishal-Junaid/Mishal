&lt;h2 id="abstract">&lt;strong>Abstract&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Predicting graduate student placement is critical for educational institutions aiming to enhance student outcomes and optimize resource allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models for graduate placement prediction through a multi-faceted approach that integrates methodological rigor with practical business applicationsÂ¹.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Utilizing a dataset of 215 graduate students, we systematically compared the performance of individual classifiers against advanced ensemble methods. The methodology is distinguished by its use of domain-driven feature engineering to create novel predictors, such as an &lt;strong>Experience-Weighted Test Score&lt;/strong>, and a comprehensive cost-benefit framework to quantify the financial impact of model implementation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Augmented Future: AI as a Partner in Business Innovation</title><link>https://Mishal.pm/posts/the-augmented-future-ai-as-a-partner-in-business-innovation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Mishal.pm/posts/the-augmented-future-ai-as-a-partner-in-business-innovation/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-augmented-future-ai-as-a-partner-in-business-innovation">&lt;strong>The Augmented Future: AI as a Partner in Business Innovation&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The conversation around Artificial Intelligence often focuses on replacement - machines taking over tasks that humans used to do. But I believe there&amp;rsquo;s a much more exciting story unfolding: &lt;strong>AI Augmentation&lt;/strong>. This approach positions AI not as a substitute for human intelligence, but as a powerful collaborator that enhances our cognitive capabilities and helps us achieve more than ever before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My AI and Web Development Journey</title><link>https://Mishal.pm/posts/my-ai-and-web-development-journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Mishal.pm/posts/my-ai-and-web-development-journey/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="my-ai-and-web-development-journey">&lt;strong>My AI and Web Development Journey&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently embarked on an exciting journey into AI and web development, leveraging my experience as a product manager at Ooredoo to explore new technical frontiers. Having successfully managed digital products and led cross-functional teams throughout my career, I&amp;rsquo;m now building the technical skills to complement my business expertise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-beginning-from-product-management-to-code">&lt;strong>The Beginning: From Product Management to Code&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My background in managing digital content and new verticals at Ooredoo gave me firsthand exposure to technology implementation, but always from the business side. I worked extensively with development teams on product specifications, feature prioritization, and user testing, which sparked my curiosity about the technical underpinnings of these digital products.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Telco Churn Prediction</title><link>https://Mishal.pm/posts/telco-churn-prediction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Mishal.pm/posts/telco-churn-prediction/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="how-i-built-a-customer-churn-prediction-app-for-telecom-companies">&lt;strong>How I Built a Customer Churn Prediction App for Telecom Companies&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I recently completed a fascinating project for my AI and Decision Making course in my Master of Business Analytics program, and I wanted to share this journey with you all. Our team tackled a real-world business problem: customer churn in the telecommunications industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge-predicting-who">&lt;strong>The Challenge: Predicting Who&amp;rsquo;s About to Leave&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Telecom companies face a constant battle to retain customers in today&amp;rsquo;s competitive market. Did you know that acquiring new customers costs significantly more than retaining existing ones? This makes identifying customers at risk of leaving (churning) incredibly valuable.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
